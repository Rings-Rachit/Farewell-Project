            <p> You, maam, have been teaching me ever since out first class on September 3, 2020. I was just 11 years old then, and very new to coding. You introduced it to me in a way that made we want to continue classes with you, and made me look forward to our interactions. So much change has occured in my life since that day on, and you've been a part of it all. I've lost a grandparent, took 2 trips to India, moved my whole life from Redmond, WA to San Diego, CA all in your presence. Granted, I wasn't the best student I could've possibly been, but I for one loved the 140+ hours we've spent together. We've had so many memorable moments throughout that I can't even list them all. That time when we fixed Minecraft, got to C100, completed a bunch of projects, moved onto text-based coding - all these times will be remembered in my memory for my whole life, and you are without doubt one of the most influntial teacher's I've ever had. I was just your student, but you were a teacher, guide, and mentor at the same time. Thank you for everything, and I hope we keep in touch. (3
